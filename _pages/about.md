Computational Psychiatry
======
Biological Psychiatry lies at the heart of my research, providing a critical framework for understanding how our genes, brain circuitry, and physiological responses interact to shape mental health. By exploring the biological roots of anxiety, mood disorders, and stress, my work aims to identify the specific molecular and neural mechanisms that underlie these conditions. Through integrating cutting-edge techniques in neuroscience and translational research, I strive to develop more precise, effective interventions—ultimately improving outcomes for individuals grappling with mental health challenges.

Experimental Psychopathology
======
Experimental Psychopathology provides a translational framework for illuminating the complexities of anxiety, mood disorders, and stress—bridging the gap from animal models to human clinical research, and ultimately from bench to bedside. By integrating neuroimaging, psychophysiology, psychopharmacology and self-report measures within innovative experimental task designs, my work captures a holistic view of the biological, psychological, and behavioral processes underpinning mental health. This approach not only refines our understanding of underlying mechanisms but also fosters the development of more targeted, evidence-based interventions.
