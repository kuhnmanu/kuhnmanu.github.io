This talk addresses the profound methodological variability in quantifying skin conductance responses (SCRs), a key psychophysiological measure. Drawing on multiverse analysis and systematic comparisons across trough-to-peak, baseline-corrected, and model-based approaches (Ledalab, PsPM), the talk demonstrates how analytical choices can substantially influence effect sizes and replicability. Despite all approaches detecting the expected effects, agreement across methods was only moderate and highly dependent on experimental parameters and response strength. The findings highlight the epistemic value of transparent analytic reporting and underscore the critical role of computational rigor in advancing reproducible psychophysiological research.
