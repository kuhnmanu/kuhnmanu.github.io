This talk provides an accessible introduction to Bayesian analysis in the context of fear conditioning research. It outlines how Bayesian methods offer a flexible and transparent framework for analyzing psychophysiological data, addressing common limitations of frequentist approaches such as p-value dependence and dichotomous thinking. Using real-world examples from fear learning paradigms, the presentation illustrates how Bayesian inference can improve parameter estimation, quantify uncertainty, and facilitate model comparison. Attendees will gain foundational insights into applying Bayesian techniques to skin conductance, startle, and behavioral data, and understand their advantages for cumulative, reproducible research in affective neuroscience.
