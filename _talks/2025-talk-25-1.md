This talk examines how individuals with remitted depression, though clinically healthy, may still show hidden vulnerabilities that increase relapse risk. Using psychophysiological, behavioral, and neuroimaging data alongside computational modeling, the presentation highlights persistent changes in stress response, emotional flexibility, and decision-making under conflict. These alterations—especially under acute stress—may reflect a core vulnerability mechanism in depression. The findings point to stress-modulated decision-making as a promising target for early intervention and relapse prevention
