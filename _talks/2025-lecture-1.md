This talk provides an introduction to the foundations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with a focus on functional MRI (fMRI) and its role in studying brain function. After covering key principles of fMRI acquisition and analysis, the discussion transitions to a hands-on example of computational psychiatry using real-world data. By integrating neuroimaging with advanced modeling techniques, we explore how brain activity patterns can inform our understanding of psychiatric disorders, particularly in the context of decision-making and affect regulation. The talk highlights the power of data-driven approaches in identifying neural markers of psychopathology and personalizing mental health interventions.
